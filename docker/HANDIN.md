# DevOps Docker Hand-In

The DevOps Docker Hand-In exercise

## Task 1

Toilet task link: <https://hub.docker.com/r/papatemps/toilet>

> Describe what you could do in order to:

* **Minimize the layers in the image**
  * Since the keyword RUN, COPY and ADD create layers, you want to minimize the use of these.

* **Minimize the overall image size. You are allowed to change everything, as long as the following command `docker run <yourusername>/toilet hello world` successfully displays a colorful variation of `hello world`**
  * To do this you should try to use in general lightweight images. As an example instead of using the ubuntu image in this task, we could use a alpine image, which is significantly lower in size.
